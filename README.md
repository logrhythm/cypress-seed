# cypress-seed

This project is a starting point to create a typescript cypress testing project. It contains `cypress` and `cypress-pipe`, along with a simple test written in typescript to demonstrate basic functionality.

# Getting started

1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. Run `yarn` in the repo directory.
3. Run `yarn cypress open` in the repo directory.
4. Use the cypress UI to run the test, verifying that it passes.
5. Modify the `cypress.json` file to point to the website you'd like to test.
6. Start testing!
